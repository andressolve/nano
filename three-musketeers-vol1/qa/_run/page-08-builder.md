# PAGE 8 — builder packet

## Fresh zero-history builder contract

You are a fresh builder for page 8, candidate vK, mode `BASE|TARGETED|FULL_PROMPT_RESET`.
Open only this packet and the explicitly listed local image inputs. Do not open
the critic card, another page's packet, another candidate, the full script, or
any prior role task. Never use a rejected candidate as an image input.

Generate with Codex in-app image generation billed to the ChatGPT subscription. Do not use an API key, the bundled image CLI, or any separately billed path.

The exact script strings, page intent, reference manifest, and story facts are
locked. Never edit `07-PAGE-CONTRACT.md` or `08-FULL-SCRIPT.md`. If the
generator will not honour a number, compensate in the prompt and nowhere else.

Generate exactly one completed candidate. Your audit reports whether the
reader-facing intent appears to land; it is a report, not a verdict, and it
never gates submission. **Submit every readable, correctly sized, non-corrupt
candidate to the independent critic — including one you are certain has
failed.** Regenerate before criticism only for a failed *generation*: wrong
canvas, corrupt or truncated output, or gross focal anatomical breakage.
Preserve the failed file and report it. A misspelled string, a wrong speaker, a
weak composition: those are the critic's to call. Write them in your audit and
submit.

Measure nothing. Do not report percentages or pixel sizes in the audit. The
generator undershoots every geometric target it is given and the pages are
fine anyway; a number in the prompt is a steering value, never a spec to audit.

The version ceiling is v6 and the count never resets. You do not
number your own versions; the orchestrator holds the count.

## Shared generation frame

### Canvas and status

One finished, flattened story page, **1024 × 1536 portrait, 2:3**, lettering baked in natively. This is a canonical production candidate for a printed illustrated novel, not a prototype, mockup, sample sheet, spread, or layout study. It is never a montage, model sheet, portrait board, or collage of the attached reference images: the references supply identity and place only, and the output is a new staged scene in which those people act, with the scripted balloons lettered in. Never landscape, never square. No page number, title, production label, speaker name, or editorial text of any kind appears on the page: the only visible text is the exact strings the page prompt lists. **Speaker names are never lettered.** The owner tag beside each exact string (a character's name, CAPTION, PROSE FIELD 1, SOUND, PRINTED OBJECT) says whose balloon or field it is; it is never rendered, never used as a prefix inside a balloon, and never placed beside one. Ownership is carried by placement and tail alone. The strings are listed in reading order and their sequence carries that order; no numeral, letter, bullet, or tag from this prompt is ever lettered on the page.

### Register — *Lantern and Steel*

Lantern and Steel. Brush-and-ink line on warm laid paper with opaque, matte gouache washes: lamp-black line, raw umber and yellow ochre, Prussian blue for the Musketeers, vermilion for the Cardinal, lead white for lace and collars, a little gold. Seventeenth-century France lit like a lantern film: candle and lantern light indoors with real cast shadows and real depth, rain-grey and river-grey outdoors, dust and dawn on the road. Visible brush line, visible paper grain, gouache drying chalky at the edge of a wash; wool, leather, wet stone, steel, and wax. Not smooth prestige-oil realism. No glossy concept-art surfaces, no airbrushed skin, no engraved cross-hatching, no anime proportions, no children's-book softness, no plastic 3D render.

Two colours own the book and oppose each other on every page they share: Musketeer blue (the cassock with the white cross) and the Cardinal's red (his robe, his guards' cassocks, the one feather in Rochefort's hat); d'Artagnan's ochre-yellow belongs to him and his horse alone. The road is ochre, dust, and dawn; Paris is grey-blue slate, brown river, and mud under an overcast sky; the house in the Rue des Fossoyeurs and the inns are warm candle and lantern light against blue-dark streets; the Carmelite field is flat bright noon on long grass and yellow stone; the quay at Calais is grey sea, wind, and spray. Two locations must look like a different world: the Cardinal's study (red hangings, black desk, one candle, no window, no daylight ever) and Buckingham's palace (white, gold, and mirror, no shadow anywhere). The Louvre ballroom is gold and a thousand candles with one column of red in it.

### The lettering law — construction numbers for the builder

Outer safe margin 64 px on every side; no essential text below 72 px from the bottom edge; minimum panel gutter 24 px; no balloon, caption, or prose field crosses a panel border. Speech lettering 44–50 px tall, short replies 48–54 px, **never below the 40 px floor**; comfortable balloon width 240–390 px; at most about 24 words in one balloon; warm ivory balloon fill, restrained dark painted outline; tails end in open space beside the speaker's mouth; silent figures get no balloon and no tail fragment. Illustrated-prose fields: lettering 36–42 px, 38–52 characters per line, paragraphs of 2–5 lines, one or two fields per page at 78–88% of the canvas width, at least 42 px internal padding, a matte parchment field in the page's palette, left-aligned with a calm ragged right edge, never over faces, hands, busy art, maps, or documents. Captions and sound cues use the same family, simplified and enlarged. One restrained editorial lettering family at three levels: speech (large, upright, hand-lettered mixed case), narrative prose (legible literary serif), small sound or object label. **Dialogue face, every page, no exceptions:** rounded hand-lettered upright mixed case, warm and slightly irregular, inside organic oval balloons with soft outlines; never a serif, never italic, never a typeset book face, never a rectangular or rounded-rectangle box. The only serif on any page is the prose field. Banned: condensed comic-display faces, geometric UI fonts, cursive body text, all-capital prose, distressed letterforms, thin old-style italics, tiny handwritten documents carrying facts. These numbers steer the generator; the only text test at the gate is whether every string reads from the **600 × 900** proof.

### Hierarchy and staging

One dominant image plainly owns the page; the share named in the prompt is a construction target, and the generator should build a clear hierarchy rather than a stack of equal bands. When the page's turn is a quiet beat (an answer, a sentence, a face changing) and another panel carries action or a crowd, the quiet panel is still the largest image on the page by far, close and tall, and the busy panel is a shallow strip seen from far back with small figures; this generator favors action tableaux and must be told otherwise. At most two small reaction insets unless causality needs a strip. A clear top-to-bottom reading path. The first speaker in a panel stands on the LEFT; opposed speakers stand on opposite sides with each balloon on its owner's side; in a three-line exchange, A upper on A's side, B middle on B's side, A's second line lower on A's side; a reply is never readable before the line that prompts it and sits clearly lower than it, never level. Every balloon's tail ends beside its own speaker's mouth; a tail into open space, into a crowd, or toward an animal is a defect. Every visible speaker's mouth is visible and its tail corridor is clear of hands, props, and bystanders. Any exchange of two short lines in one panel where either line could plausibly be spoken by either character (a question and its answer, a check and its confirmation, a one-word address) is staged as two single-speaker beats, the questioner alone with mouth visible and the balloon beside that mouth, then the answerer alone the same way, as stacked strips or a strip cut into two panels read left to right; a shared two-shot with crossing tails is the most common attribution failure on this generator. A focal action uses exactly two hands, named. Consequential objects that the story counts (five of something, three of something) are drawn in a spaced row so the reader can count them, and the prompt says "count them". Sound cues render the exact letters given, with no added punctuation or extra words; the run length of a repeated letter is not a defect. Words painted on a story object (a banner, a plaque, a sign) are object text: they must read exactly as scripted, and the same object seen in two panels may carry them twice. Nothing else is lettered: no laugh lines, no invented captions, no labels. Vertical accumulation for time, consequence, descent, isolation, aftermath. Unnamed figures never carry a complete reserved identity stack: The Cardinal's guards wear the red cassock with the white cross and plain steel morions or wide hats with no feather, faces generic and turned away, never a scar; other Musketeers in the street wear the blue cassock and are clean-shaven or full-bearded, never a dark pointed beard, never a red-brown waxed moustache, never blond curls; innkeepers, stable boys, and sailors are bareheaded and aproned; the sergeant at Calais is a red cassock with a paper in his hand; the court at the ball is gold and silver silk and nobody in it wears red, ochre, or a black doublet; the Queen is a figure in white and silver with a small crown, seen from behind or at a distance, face never close; the King is a crowned figure seated on the dais, no face; the jeweler is an old man at a bench with a loupe. No background man is beardless and black-haired in ochre. No background man has a scar. No background figure ever carries a balloon.

### How each kind of input binds

Attached character sheets are identity locks: the face, build, posture, costume state, and habitual gesture on the sheet are reproduced exactly, and the prompt's lock clause names which traits must survive at page scale. Setting plates bind architecture, palette, light logic, and the location's accent; they carry no figures, and the page adds the people. Object plates bind the state and silhouette of consequential objects. **Promoted pages are never attached as inputs:** a lettered page is a copy target for this generator (Volume I's page 3 reproduced page 2 wholesale), and continuity across the page turn rests on the sheets and plates, which is what the locks are for. Boards are never inputs. The model draws what it is shown: never attach a lookalike as a negative example, never attach a rejected candidate.

## Page intent

## PAGE 8

Dramatic. A Paris street corner. d'Artagnan, at a dead run after the scar, goes straight into the sling of a very tall Musketeer, and the tall man goes white. This is Athos: very tall, very still, grey eyes, his good hand holding his bad shoulder, while the boy, already two steps past, looks back over his own shoulder for the man who has vanished. The tall man observes that the shoulder was hurt before the boy arrived; the boy apologises and says he cannot stop; the tall man says he has stopped. Face to face, the boy offers satisfaction and never refuses a fight; the tall man names the field behind the Carmelite convent at noon and tells him to bring a friend to stand with him; the boy has none. The dominant turn is Athos's shoulder and the appointment at noon. Athos owns the stillness, d'Artagnan the heat. The reader turns because the boy has a duel at noon with the tallest man in Paris and has lost the scar. The street is scenery; the sling and the two faces are the page.

## Builder-only page prompt

## PAGE 8 — a shoulder in the way

### Reader turn
Running after the scar, the boy slams into a Musketeer's bandaged shoulder, and by the end of the panel he has a duel at noon and no friend to bring.

### Ordered moments
1. Panel one, about 30%, a strip: the corner of a narrow Paris street, the boy in ochre on the LEFT at a full run colliding shoulder-first into the black sling of a very tall Musketeer in blue on the RIGHT, the impact the centre of the strip. The sound cue at the collision in large simple letters. No balloons here.
2. Panel two, the dominant panel, about 45%, close and tall: Athos on the RIGHT, very tall, very still, white-faced, his good hand holding the slung shoulder; the boy on the LEFT already two steps past him, twisted to look back over his own shoulder up the street for the vanished scar. Three balloons in A–B–A order: Athos's first line upper right by his mouth, the boy's apology middle left by his, Athos's two-word answer lower right, clearly third, tail to Athos's mouth.
3. Panel three, about 25%: face to face, the boy on the LEFT hot, Athos on the RIGHT level and a head taller. Three balloons in A–B–A order: the boy's challenge upper left, Athos's appointment middle right, the boy's last line lower left, each tail to its own mouth, the reply never level with the line that prompts it.

### Exact strings
SOUND: `WHUMP`
ATHOS: `That was my shoulder. It was hurt before you arrived.`
D'ARTAGNAN: `I'm sorry, sir! I'm chasing a man! I can't stop!`
ATHOS: `You've stopped.`
D'ARTAGNAN: `You want satisfaction? Name the place. I never refuse a fight.`
ATHOS: `The field behind the Carmelite convent. Noon. Bring a friend to stand with you.`
D'ARTAGNAN: `I don't have any.`

Render exactly these 7 strings once each, in this order, with clear ownership; no other text anywhere on the page.

### Character locks
d'Artagnan, keyed to his sheet: eighteen, long narrow face, sharp chin, long straight nose, close-set quick dark eyes, clean-shaven with no moustache, black unruly hair in his eyes, lean and narrow-shouldered, weight forward, one hand on a plain swept-hilt rapier too long for him; faded ochre-yellow doublet, brown breeches and boots, grey felt hat with one broken feather, no cloak (default state, pp 1–32). Athos, keyed to his sheet's sling view: thirty, the tallest man in the book, long pale face, hooded level grey eyes, lines beside the mouth, dark hair straight to the shoulder, a short pointed dark beard and neat moustache, lean; blue cassock with the white cross over a black doublet, black hat with one white plume; LEFT arm in a black cloth sling (sling state, pp 8–16); good hand on the pommel of his grounded sword; the one man in any panel not moving. The risky pair on this page by type is Athos against the absent Rochefort; keep Athos's pointed beard, blue cassock, white plume, and sling so he can never be taken for the scar. Passers-by are scenery, faceless, no balloons.

### Consequential exclusions
Rochefort is absent from this page: no red feather, no scar, no black horse anywhere in the street. Porthos, Aramis, and Constance are absent. No blood: the sling is an old injury already bandaged, nothing is drawn as a wound. The boy's sword stays sheathed. No lettering on shop signs or walls; only the six spoken strings and the one sound cue.
