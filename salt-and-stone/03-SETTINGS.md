# Salt and Stone — Setting Definitions

## NIKOS'S ISLAND (Aegean, unnamed small island)

```
SETTING: NIKOS'S ISLAND (consistent geography):
- Key landmarks: Small rocky harbor with a stone jetty, a half-built wooden ship hull on the beach, whitewashed stone houses climbing a dry hillside, a single olive grove on the ridge
- Vegetation/terrain: Rocky dry terrain, wild thyme and scrub bushes, dusty paths between houses, pebble beach turning to dark sand near the water
- Atmosphere: Bright Mediterranean sun, deep blue sea, white-gold light, constant wind. The harbor is sheltered but you can always see open ocean beyond.
```

## ALEXIOS'S SHIPYARD (on the island)

```
SETTING: ALEXIOS'S SHIPYARD (consistent details):
- Key landmarks: Open-air workshop on the beach beside the harbor, a large ship hull in timber frame (ribs exposed like a skeleton), stacks of oak and pine planks, rope coils, pitch barrels, tool racks
- Vegetation/terrain: Sand and gravel floor, wood shavings everywhere, the smell of pine resin and tar
- Atmosphere: Warm, industrious, sawdust in sunbeams, the sound of hammers and adzes. The sea is visible in the background through the open workshop.
```

## THE BURNING (raid on the island)

```
SETTING: THE BURNING (consistent atmosphere):
- Key landmarks: The same harbor and village, now with Persian warships in the harbor (dark-hulled triremes with painted eyes on the prow), buildings on fire, smoke columns rising
- Atmosphere: Orange firelight against dark smoke, chaos, running figures silhouetted against flames, the contrast between the peaceful blue sea and the destruction on land. Night or pre-dawn.
```

## THE SHIPWRECK COAST (between Greece and Phoenicia)

```
SETTING: SHIPWRECK COAST (consistent geography):
- Key landmarks: Rocky unfamiliar coastline, nothing like home — flatter, sandier, with sparse low vegetation. Wreckage on the shore: broken timber, torn sail cloth, rope. No harbor, no buildings visible.
- Atmosphere: Gray dawn after a storm. The sea is flat and exhausted. Seabirds. Isolation. The light is cool and flat, not the warm gold of home.
```

## SIDON (Phoenician port city)

```
SETTING: SIDON (consistent geography):
- Key landmarks: Massive stone harbor with a fortified sea wall, merchant ships of many nations crowding the docks, a dense city of flat-roofed stone buildings rising behind the waterfront, colorful awnings and market stalls along the quay, the famous Phoenician purple dye vats visible near the shore (stinking pools of murex shells)
- Vegetation/terrain: Dusty stone streets, date palms along the harbor road, cedar wood stacked on the docks. Busier, louder, more crowded than anything Nikos has seen.
- Atmosphere: Hot, noisy, multilingual — Greek, Phoenician, Egyptian, Persian accents everywhere. The air smells of salt, dye, cedar, and fish. Overwhelming to a boy from a tiny island.
```

## HASDRUBAL'S WORKSHOP (in Sidon)

```
SETTING: HASDRUBAL'S WORKSHOP (consistent details):
- Key landmarks: Enclosed stone workshop near the Sidon docks, larger and more permanent than Alexios's open-air yard. Ship ribs in frames, but also models and drawings on shelves. Phoenician shipbuilding tools (similar but different from Greek ones). Oil lamps. A workbench covered in plans scratched on wax tablets.
- Atmosphere: Dim, warm, the smell of cedar (not pine — different wood, different world). Orderly and precise — Hasdrubal runs a tight workshop. The contrast with Alexios's more chaotic yard is deliberate.
