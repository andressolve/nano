- Hair: Thick black hair, roughly cut, falls just past his ears, perpetually wind-tangled
- Eyes: Dark brown, almost black, intense and alert
- Signature marks: A thin pale scar across his left palm (from a chisel slip), calloused hands older than his age
- Outfit: Rough-woven off-white chiton (knee-length tunic) belted with a strip of brown leather, bare feet
- Accessories: A small wooden carving knife tucked into his belt, a leather cord necklace with a single pierced shell

Left panel — Portrait (head and shoulders):
Close-up showing face clearly. Expression: calm but watchful, looking directly at viewer. Dark brown eyes clearly visible. Hair texture wind-tangled. Olive skin with sun exposure. Neutral expression to serve as baseline reference.

Right panel — Full body:
Standing pose, weight balanced, facing slightly angled (3/4 view). Full outfit visible: off-white chiton belted with brown leather, bare feet on sandy ground. Wooden carving knife visible at belt. Shell necklace visible. Calloused hands visible. Full height visible from head to feet.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Background: Simple warm neutral gradient, non-distracting
Lighting: Soft, even lighting from front-left to clearly show all details without harsh shadows. Studio reference lighting style.

General Instruction:
This is a reference sheet for character consistency. Both views must show the exact same person with identical features. Prioritize clarity of details over dramatic atmosphere. All identifying features must be clearly visible. This is a historical setting — ancient Greece, approximately 480 BC.
STYLE REINFORCEMENT: This is NOT a children's book illustration. Render in a serious, mature graphic novel style with realistic proportions, natural lighting, and cinematic composition. The protagonist is young but the visual treatment is adult. No oversized eyes, no rounded cartoon features, no soft focus, no whimsy.

Aspect Ratio: 4:3 (landscape)

## Notes on Character Aging

Nikos appears at three ages across the full graphic novel:
- **Life One (this chapter):** Age 9-10. Use the reference above.
- **Life Two (future chapter):** Age 14-15. A new reference sheet will be needed — taller, face more angular, same eyes and scar, hair longer.
- **Life Three (future chapter):** Age 19-20. Another reference sheet — young man's build, beginnings of facial hair, same core features.

The shell necklace and palm scar are the visual throughlines across all three lives. The wooden carving knife is replaced in Life Two but referenced.
