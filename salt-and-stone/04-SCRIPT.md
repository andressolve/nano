## Full Script with Panel Breakdowns

## COVER PAGE

```
create image: Subject:
A cinematic book cover composition. A small boy stands at the edge of a rocky shore, his back to the viewer, looking out at an immense dark sea. The wind pulls at his rough tunic and tangles his black hair. To his left in the background, a half-built ship skeleton on a beach. To his right, far in the distance, smoke rises from a burning village. The horizon line divides the image — sea below, vast sky above.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Natural Mediterranean light, atmospheric depth, salt-air haze, wind visible in hair and cloth

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical — seen from behind):
- 9-year-old Greek boy, lean and wiry, tanned olive skin
- Thick black hair, roughly cut, wind-tangled
- Rough-woven off-white chiton belted with brown leather, bare feet
- Shell necklace just visible at his neck
- Standing on dark wet rocks at the waterline

Visual composition:
- Foreground: Nikos on rocks, small against the world
- Middle ground: The dark churning sea
- Background left: Ship skeleton on beach (his past)
- Background right: Distant smoke (his loss)
- Top 20% reserved for title

Text (Title, top center, bold): "SALT AND STONE"
Text (Subtitle, below title, smaller): "Life One: The Boy"

General Instruction:
Title text should be large, bold, weathered — as if carved in stone. The mood should feel vast, lonely, and serious. A boy at the threshold between one life and the next. This is not a children's book aesthetic — it is a serious historical graphic novel.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

CHARACTER ALEXIOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL ALEXIOS CHARACTER LOCK BLOCK FROM 02-CHARACTERS.md]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide Horizontal):
Visual: Wide establishing shot of the island harbor at sunrise. Whitewashed houses climb a dry hillside. A small stone jetty. Two fishing boats moored. On the beach, the skeleton of a half-built ship in a timber frame — ribs exposed like a whale carcass. Bright Aegean blue sea, golden morning light. A figure of a boy (Nikos) runs along the jetty toward the shipyard.
Text (Caption Box): "My father said the sea gives you everything and takes it back whenever it wants."

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Medium shot inside the open-air shipyard. Alexios works on the hull of the ship, shaping a plank with an adze. Sawdust floats in sunbeams. His scarred forearms and missing fingertip visible. He is focused, powerful, at ease.
Text (Caption Box): "He said this like it was just the weather. Not good. Not bad. Just true."

Panel 3 (Middle Right, Square):
Visual: Close-up of young Nikos's hands working a piece of wood with his small carving knife. His hands are already calloused. The thin scar on his left palm is visible. Wood shavings curl from the blade. He is concentrating hard, tongue between his teeth.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide Horizontal):
Visual: Medium-wide shot of Alexios and Nikos together at the end of the day, sitting on the unfinished ship's keel, legs dangling. The sunset turns the sea copper and gold. Alexios has his hand on Nikos's shoulder. Both looking out at the horizon. Peaceful.
Text (Speech Bubble - Alexios): "A ship is just a promise, Nikos. Wood and rope — that's nothing. The promise is what carries people home."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes and speech bubbles. The atmosphere should feel warm, golden, safe — a world that is about to be lost. Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

## PAGE 2 — The Craft

**Narrative beat:** Show Nikos learning — he's not just a child, he has real skill. His identity is tied to building.

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 4 panels arranged in four rows, each panel spanning the full width. The setting is Alexios's shipyard on the island, midday. Bright harsh sun.

Effects: Natural Mediterranean light, harsh midday shadows, sawdust in air

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

CHARACTER ALEXIOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL ALEXIOS LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Alexios holds up two pieces of wood for Nikos to examine. One is oak, one is pine. He is teaching. Nikos looks at them seriously, not like a bored child — like an apprentice.
Text (Speech Bubble - Alexios): "Which one for the keel?"
Text (Speech Bubble - Nikos): "Oak. Pine rots in salt water."

Panel 2 (Upper Middle, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's hands fitting a wooden peg into a joint. The fit is precise. His small carving knife rests nearby. Sawdust on his fingers. This is skilled work.
Text (Caption Box): "He never told me I was too young. He just handed me the next tool."

Panel 3 (Lower Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot from behind Nikos, looking over his shoulder at the ship hull taking shape. The ribs are nearly complete now. It's beautiful — like a cathedral of wood. The sea is visible through the gaps in the ribs.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot, end of day. Nikos walks along the beach alone, carrying an armful of timber offcuts. His shadow is long on the sand. The half-built ship looms behind him. The sea is calm and dark blue.
Text (Caption Box): "I thought this was what my life would be. Building things that carried people across the water."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes and speech bubbles. The atmosphere should feel industrious, warm, and grounded. Show competence and skill, not childhood innocence. Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

## PAGE 3 — Fire on the Water

**Narrative beat:** The raid begins. Violence shatters the world without warning.

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 4 panels arranged in three rows: top row is one wide horizontal panel (tall — takes up 40% of the page), middle row has two panels side by side, bottom row is one wide horizontal panel. The setting is the island at night. Persian warships approaching the harbor. Fire.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Night scene — orange firelight against deep blue-black sky, smoke, chaos

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide Horizontal, LARGE — 40% of page):
Visual: Wide dramatic shot of the harbor at night. Three dark-hulled Persian warships (triremes with painted eyes on the prow) entering the small harbor. Torches and fire arrows visible. The first buildings on shore are catching fire. Orange flames reflected in the dark water. Villagers running on the jetty as silhouettes against the fire.
Text (Caption Box): "They came on a night with no moon."

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's face waking up in darkness. His eyes are wide, reflecting orange firelight from outside. He is terrified but not screaming — frozen.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 3 (Middle Right, Square):
Visual: Medium shot through a doorway. Nikos sees his village burning — houses on fire, people running, the dark shapes of Persian soldiers moving between buildings. Chaos. Viewed from inside the dark safety of his home looking out into horror.
Text (Sound Effect, large): "KRAAASH"

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide Horizontal):
Visual: Medium shot. Alexios grabs Nikos by the arm, pulling him through the darkness. Alexios has his adze in his other hand — not as a tool now, as a weapon. His face is grim, determined. Nikos stumbles, looking back at their burning home.
Text (Speech Bubble - Alexios): "Don't look back. Move."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes and speech bubbles. The atmosphere should feel sudden, violent, and disorienting — the safe world of the first two pages is destroyed. Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 4 — The Choice

**Narrative beat:** Alexios puts Nikos on a departing trade ship. The father stays behind.

```
create image: Subject:

Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Firelight on dark water, smoke, urgency

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

CHARACTER ALEXIOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL ALEXIOS LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot of the harbor. A small Greek merchant ship is casting off from the jetty, sailors hauling ropes. People are scrambling aboard — women, children, old men. Behind them, the village burns. Persian soldiers on the shore. Alexios runs toward the ship carrying Nikos.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up. Alexios kneels at the jetty edge, gripping Nikos by both shoulders, face to face. The fire is behind Alexios, silhouetting him. His expression is fierce with love. Nikos is crying.
Text (Speech Bubble - Alexios): "Listen to me. You know wood. You know the sea. That's enough. That's everything."

Panel 3 (Middle Right, Square):
Visual: Medium shot. Alexios lifts Nikos and passes him to reaching hands on the merchant ship. The gap between jetty and ship is dark water. Nikos reaches back toward his father.
Text (Speech Bubble - Nikos): "Come with me!"

Panel 4 (Wide):
Visual: Medium shot from the ship looking back. Alexios stands alone on the jetty, adze in hand, watching the ship pull away. Fire behind him. He is not coming. He raises one hand — not waving, just holding it up. A farewell.
Text (Speech Bubble - Alexios): "Build something, Nikos."

Panel 5 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot. The merchant ship moving away from the burning island into dark open sea. The island shrinks behind them — a glow of fire on the horizon. Nikos is a small figure at the stern, looking back.
Text (Caption Box): "That was the last time I saw my father."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes and speech bubbles. This is the emotional peak of the first act. The mood should feel devastating but not melodramatic — restrained grief. Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 5 — The Sea

**Narrative beat:** Alone on the trade ship. The sea as emptiness. Transition.

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels arranged vertically (top panel takes 50% of the page, two smaller panels below). The setting is open sea, a small Greek merchant ship, days after the raid. Gray overcast sky. Flat calm water.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Overcast light, flat gray sea, emptiness, muted colors — the warmth of home is gone

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, LARGE — 50% of page):
Visual: Wide atmospheric shot. The merchant ship small in frame, alone on a vast gray sea. Overcast sky. No land visible in any direction. The world is water and sky, nothing else. A desolate, beautiful emptiness.
Text (Caption Box): "Three days on open water."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "The other refugees slept or wept. I did neither."

Panel 2 (Bottom Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos sitting against the ship's hull, knees drawn up. He is carving a small piece of driftwood with his knife — the only thing he carried from home. His face is blank, shut down. Not crying. Past crying.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 3 (Bottom Right, Square):
Visual: Close-up of what Nikos is carving — it's taking the shape of a small ship hull. Even in shock, his hands know what to do. The carving is rough but recognizable. His scarred left palm visible holding the piece.
Text (Caption Box): "My hands remembered what the rest of me wanted to forget."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. No speech bubbles on this page — Nikos speaks to no one. The atmosphere should feel empty, gray, suspended — between one life and the next. Featuring the same character shown in the reference image.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3
```

## PAGE 6 — The Storm and the Wreck

**Narrative beat:** The shipwreck. Nikos's second loss — even the ship that saved him is destroyed.

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 4 panels arranged in three rows: top panel wide, two middle panels side by side, bottom panel wide (takes 40% of the page). A storm at sea and a shipwreck.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Storm — dark green-gray sea, white spray, driving rain, dramatic diagonal lighting from lightning

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide dramatic shot. The merchant ship pitched at a steep angle on a massive wave. Dark storm clouds. Rain driving sideways. Lightning illuminating the scene. Sailors clinging to ropes. Terrifying power of the sea.
Text (Caption Box): "The sea gives you everything and takes it back whenever it wants."

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos gripping a rope with both hands, drenched, eyes wide. Water crashes over the deck. His shell necklace is plastered to his chest. He is holding on with everything he has.
Text (Sound Effect, large, jagged): "KRAAAKOOM"

Panel 3 (Middle Right, Square):
Visual: The ship breaking apart — the hull splitting, timber splintering. Dark water pouring in. Figures falling into the sea. Chaos.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide, LARGE — 40% of page):
Visual: Underwater shot. Nikos sinking in dark green water, surrounded by debris — broken planks, rope, torn sail. Air bubbles rising from his mouth. His eyes are open. One hand still grips his small carved wooden ship. Light from above filtered through churning water. Beautiful and terrifying.
Text: [No Text]

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes and sound effect text. The atmosphere should feel overwhelming, violent, elemental. The callback to Alexios's words ("the sea gives you everything...") should land hard. Featuring the same character shown in the reference image.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 7 — The Shore

**Narrative beat:** Nikos washes ashore on an unknown coast. Alone. Starting from nothing.

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels arranged vertically: top panel (30%), middle panel (30%), bottom panel (40% — large). An unknown rocky coastline at gray dawn. After the storm.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Post-storm light — gray, flat, exhausted. Cool tones. Muted colors. Seabirds.

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide establishing shot. A flat, unfamiliar coastline at dawn. Wreckage scattered on the beach — broken timber, torn sailcloth, rope tangled on rocks. Low scrubby vegetation. No buildings. No harbor. No people. This is not Greece. The light is flat and gray.
Text (Caption Box): "I woke up in a place that had no name."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos lies face-down on wet sand among wreckage. He is barely conscious. His chiton is torn and salt-stained. One hand still clutches the small carved wooden ship. Seabirds stand nearby, watching. His shell necklace is still around his neck — the only things he carried from one life to the next.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide, LARGE):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos pushes himself up to sitting, looking around. He is small, battered, alone on an empty coast. His expression is not despair — it's a kind of blankness. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't know what to do. Behind him the flat gray sea. In front of him, unknown land.
Text (Caption Box): "Everything I was — gone."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "Everything I knew how to do — useless."
Text (Caption Box, lowest): "Almost."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. No speech — Nikos is alone. The atmosphere should feel desolate but not hopeless. The word "almost" is the turn — his hands still know how to build. Featuring the same character shown in the reference image.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 8 — Sidon

**Narrative beat:** Nikos reaches Sidon. Overwhelmed by a world completely unlike home.

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 4 panels arranged in three rows: top panel wide and LARGE (45% of page), two middle panels side by side, bottom panel wide. The Phoenician port city of Sidon, approximately 480 BC. Midday, blazing sun.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Blazing Mediterranean sun, crowded harbor atmosphere, overwhelming scale and noise

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide, LARGE — 45%):
Visual: Wide establishing shot of Sidon's harbor — a MASSIVE stone harbor with a fortified sea wall. Dozens of merchant ships crowding the docks. Flat-roofed stone buildings rising densely behind the waterfront. Colorful awnings over market stalls. Crowds of people — Phoenician, Egyptian, Persian, Greek. Cranes, cargo, animals. Overwhelming. Nikos stands in the foreground at the harbor's edge, tiny against this enormous city. He is dirty, torn, barefoot.
Text (Caption Box): "They called it Sidon. I called it nowhere I understood."

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos moving through the crowded market, jostled by adults who don't see him. Foreign writing on signs. Strange food. Different clothing. He looks lost and wary, gripping his carved wooden ship in his hand.
Text (Caption Box): "No one spoke Greek. The food smelled wrong. The buildings had no color."

Panel 3 (Middle Right, Square):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos crouches in an alley between stone buildings, watching the market. He is hungry, calculating, figuring out how this place works. Not crying. Working the problem.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot of the Sidon docks at sunset. Merchant ships being unloaded. Workers carrying cargo. Nikos, small in the frame, approaches the dock workers, looking for a way in — any way to be useful.
Text (Caption Box): "A boy with no language and no family has exactly one thing to trade: his willingness to work."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. The atmosphere should feel overwhelming but not hostile — just enormous, foreign, and indifferent. Nikos is resourceful, not pitiful. Featuring the same character shown in the reference image.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 9 — The Docks

**Narrative beat:** Nikos works the docks. Survives by being useful. Notices Hasdrubal's shipyard.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Hot midday harbor light, dust, exertion

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos carries a heavy coil of rope across the docks, struggling under the weight. He is filthy and thin but working hard. Dock workers move around him. He has learned to make himself useful — carrying, hauling, fetching. No one pays him but sometimes they share food.
Text (Caption Box): "I learned Phoenician the way dogs learn — by watching what happened when someone pointed."

Panel 2 (Upper Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos eats a piece of flatbread on the dock's edge, feet dangling. He watches a nearby shipyard — not Hasdrubal's yet, a larger commercial yard. Ships being built. His eyes are locked on the work with recognition and hunger.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 3 (Lower Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot from behind Nikos. He has wandered to the entrance of a smaller, more precise shipyard — HASDRUBAL'S WORKSHOP. He can see inside: ship ribs in frames, tools on walls, a stocky older man (Hasdrubal, seen at a distance) examining a hull joint with a measuring cord. Nikos recognizes the craft. It's different from his father's methods but the same language underneath.
Text (Caption Box): "I couldn't read their writing. I couldn't speak their words. But I could read a hull joint from twenty paces."

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's face, watching through the workshop entrance. His expression has changed — for the first time since the shipwreck, something other than blankness. Recognition. Purpose. His dark eyes are sharp and focused.
Text: [No Text]

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. The mood shifts on this page — from survival to the first spark of possibility. Featuring the same character shown in the reference image.

## PAGE 10 — Noticed

**Narrative beat:** Hasdrubal catches Nikos watching, and Nikos proves he knows ships.

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 5 panels arranged in four rows: top panel wide, two side-by-side panels, one wide panel, one bottom panel. Hasdrubal's workshop entrance and interior. Afternoon.

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

CHARACTER HASDRUBAL (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL HASDRUBAL LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Hasdrubal stands in his workshop doorway, arms crossed, looking down at Nikos who stands outside. Hasdrubal is evaluating — not angry, not friendly. Shrewd. His burn-scarred left hand is visible. His three gold earrings catch the light. Nikos looks up at him, not cowering but alert.
Text (Speech Bubble - Hasdrubal): "[in Phoenician] You again. Every day watching."

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's face. He doesn't understand the words. He shakes his head slightly. But he points past Hasdrubal into the workshop — at a hull joint being assembled.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 3 (Middle Right, Square):
Visual: Close-up of the hull joint Nikos is pointing at. It's being fitted wrong — even the reader can see the grain direction is off. Nikos mimes with his hands — turning, adjusting — showing the correct orientation.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 4 (Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Hasdrubal looks at the joint, then back at Nikos. His expression shifts — surprise, then the beginning of respect. He hands Nikos a piece of scrap wood and a Phoenician carving tool (different from a Greek knife, but similar enough).
Text (Speech Bubble - Hasdrubal): "[in Phoenician] Show me."

Panel 5 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's hands working the unfamiliar Phoenician tool on the scrap wood. The tool is different but his hands adapt. Clean, confident cuts. Hasdrubal's burn-scarred hand rests on the workbench nearby, watching.
Text (Caption Box): "He handed me a tool I had never held. My hands knew it anyway."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes and speech bubbles. Hasdrubal's dialogue is in Phoenician — Nikos doesn't understand the words, only the gesture. The atmosphere should feel like a test being passed. Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 11 — Apprentice

**Narrative beat:** Nikos begins learning Phoenician shipbuilding. Different methods, same craft. Time passes.

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

CHARACTER HASDRUBAL (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL HASDRUBAL LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos and Hasdrubal work side by side on a hull plank. Hasdrubal demonstrates a Phoenician technique — mortise-and-tenon joining, different from the Greek method Nikos learned. Hasdrubal explains with hands and gestures since they still share limited language. The workshop is warm and ordered — oil lamps, tools on walls, wax tablets with plans.
Text (Caption Box): "His ships were built shell-first — planks before ribs. My father built ribs first, then planks."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "Different answers. Same question: how do you make wood float?"

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up of a Phoenician ship model on a shelf — a round-hulled merchant vessel, very different from a Greek trireme. Nikos studies it, tracing the hull curve with his finger. Learning a new shape.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 3 (Middle Right, Square):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos sits at the workbench in the evening, a small oil lamp beside him. He is practicing Phoenician letters on a wax tablet — the scratched, crude letters of a boy teaching himself to write a foreign language. His carved wooden ship from home sits on the bench beside the tablet.
Text (Caption Box): "I learned their words the way I learned their wood — by touch."

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot at the end of a workday. Hasdrubal and Nikos walk from the workshop toward the harbor. The sun is setting over Sidon's waterfront. Hasdrubal's hand rests briefly on Nikos's shoulder — an echo of the way Alexios used to touch him. Nikos notices. His expression is complex — gratitude and grief at the same time.
Text: [No Text]

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. The atmosphere should feel warm, orderly, and healing — a new kind of home being built, slowly. The echo of Alexios in Hasdrubal's gesture should be felt, not explained. Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

**Narrative beat:** Nikos discovers that Phoenician ships serve the Persian fleet — the same Persians who destroyed his home. The central moral question.

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

CHARACTER HASDRUBAL (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL HASDRUBAL LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot of Sidon's harbor. A Persian warship — a massive trireme with a painted eye on the prow and Persian military standards — is moored at the main dock. Persian soldiers and Phoenician sailors work together loading supplies. Nikos stands at a distance watching. He recognizes the ship type. His expression is hard.
Text (Caption Box): "I had been in Sidon for two months when I understood."

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's face, staring at the Persian warship. His jaw is tight. His dark eyes reflect the painted eye of the ship. This is the same kind of ship that raided his island. The enemy.
Text (Caption Box): "The ships that burned my home were built in yards like Hasdrubal's."

Panel 3 (Middle Right, Square):
Visual: Medium shot. Hasdrubal in his workshop, working calmly on a hull component. He is unaware of Nikos's turmoil. On his workbench, a wax tablet with notes — and a contract seal with Persian script visible. Hasdrubal builds ships for Persia. It's just business.
Text (Caption Box): "The man who gave me a second life built ships for the men who destroyed my first one."

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos stands at the workshop entrance, looking in at Hasdrubal working. He is torn — his body language is tense, caught between the doorframe. Half in, half out. Should he stay? Should he leave? Where would he go?
Text (Caption Box): "My father would have called Hasdrubal an enemy."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "My father never met him."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. No speech bubbles — this page is interior. The atmosphere should feel tense and morally complicated. There is no easy answer and the narrative does not provide one. Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 13 — Staying

**Narrative beat:** Nikos makes his choice. He stays. Not because it's easy but because he is learning what matters more than sides.

A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels arranged vertically: top (30%), middle (30%), bottom (40% — large). Hasdrubal's workshop and the Sidon waterfront. Late afternoon, golden light.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Late afternoon golden light, warm shadows, emotional weight

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

CHARACTER HASDRUBAL (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL HASDRUBAL LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos enters the workshop the next morning. He picks up a Phoenician adze and joins Hasdrubal at the hull they're building. He doesn't speak. Hasdrubal glances at him — he knows something shifted, but he doesn't ask. He just nods.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of both sets of hands working the same hull plank — Hasdrubal's large, burn-scarred hands and Nikos's small, scar-palmed hands. Working together. Different hands, same purpose. The wood grain is beautiful in the lamplight.
Text (Caption Box): "I stayed because a hull joint doesn't care who your king is."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide, LARGE):
Visual: Wide shot of the Sidon waterfront at sunset. Ships at anchor. The city glowing in late golden light. Nikos sits on a stone wall at the harbor's edge, legs dangling, looking out at the sea. His carved wooden ship from home is in one hand. He is calm — not happy exactly, but settled. He has made a decision.
Text (Caption Box): "My father said a ship is just a promise."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "He didn't say whose promise. He didn't say which ship."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. The atmosphere should feel resolved — warm, golden, earned. This is not a triumphant ending but a quiet one. Nikos has chosen to stay in the world that took everything from him, because he found something true inside it. Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

## PAGE 14 — Building

**Narrative beat:** Time passes. Nikos grows into his new life. He builds.

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 4 panels arranged in four horizontal rows, each spanning full width. Hasdrubal's workshop, months later. Nikos is visibly stronger, more confident.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Warm workshop light, passage of time, growing confidence

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

CHARACTER HASDRUBAL (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL HASDRUBAL LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos works independently now — shaping a keel timber with a Phoenician adze. His movements are confident. He's slightly bigger, a bit more muscle from months of hard work. Hasdrubal works across the shop, occasionally glancing over — checking, not correcting.
Text (Caption Box): "Months passed. My Phoenician came in rough, then smoother."

Panel 2 (Upper Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos and Hasdrubal eat together at the workbench — flatbread, olives, dried fish. Talking. Nikos gestures, explaining something about Greek hull construction. Hasdrubal listens, interested. Two craftsmen comparing methods.
Text (Speech Bubble - Nikos): "Greeks build the ribs first, then fit the skin."
Text (Speech Bubble - Hasdrubal): "Backwards."
Text (Speech Bubble - Nikos): "That's what I thought about yours."

Panel 3 (Lower Middle, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot of a completed merchant ship in Hasdrubal's yard, ready for launch. It is beautiful — a Phoenician round-hulled vessel, lovingly built. Nikos stands looking up at it. He helped build this. A real ship that will carry real people.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of the workbench. Nikos's carved wooden ship from home sits beside a new carving — a Phoenician-style vessel. Two ships side by side. Two lives. Same hands.
Text (Caption Box): "I was nine when the sea took everything."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "I was ten when I started building it back."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes and speech bubbles. This page should feel like growth — time passing, competence building, a life being rebuilt. Not rushed. Earned. Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 15 — The Sea Again

**Narrative beat:** Final page. Nikos on the Sidon waterfront. He looks at the sea — no longer as a victim but as someone who will cross it again. Foreshadows Life Two.

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels: top panel wide (25%), middle panel wide (25%), bottom panel LARGE (50% — splash). Sidon harbor. Dawn. The beginning of something new.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Dawn light — golden and cool blue mixed. The first warm light touching the sea. Vast and open.

CHARACTER NIKOS (must appear identical in all panels):
[PASTE FULL NIKOS LOCK BLOCK]

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos walks through the Sidon docks at dawn, before the city wakes. He passes merchant ships from a dozen nations — Greek, Egyptian, Persian, Carthaginian. He walks among them easily now. This is his world too.
Text (Caption Box): "People think your life is one story."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's hand on a ship's hull. He runs his fingers along the planking, feeling the joints, reading the wood by touch. The scar on his palm is visible. Behind his hand, the vast harbor opens up.
Text (Caption Box): "It's not. It's the sea — it gives you everything, and takes it back, and gives you something else."

Panel 3 (Bottom, SPLASH — 50% of page):
Visual: Wide cinematic shot. Nikos stands at the very end of Sidon's stone jetty, looking out at the open Mediterranean at dawn. The sun is rising ahead of him — the direction of Greece, the direction of everything that comes next. He is small but upright. The wind pulls at his tunic and hair. His shell necklace is visible. The sea stretches to the horizon. Behind him, the city. Ahead of him, everything unknown.
Text (Caption Box, lower right): "And if you're still breathing, you build again."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. This is the final page of Life One. The atmosphere should feel open, vast, and forward-looking. Not an ending — a threshold. The same composition as the cover but reversed: on the cover he looked out at loss, here he looks out at possibility. Featuring the same character shown in the reference image.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## BACK COVER

```
create image: Subject:
A simple, contemplative back cover image. Two small wooden carved ships sit side by side on a weathered stone surface — one Greek-style (angular, sharp prow) and one Phoenician-style (round-hulled, broader). They are lit by warm afternoon light. The sea is visible in the blurred background. Simple and symbolic.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: Aegean blue, sun-bleached gold, burnt sienna, charcoal black, weathered stone gray
Effects: Warm golden light, shallow depth of field, contemplative stillness

Visual composition:
- Two small wooden carvings on stone, centered
- Warm light from the left
- Background soft/blurred — sea and sky
- Upper third left open for text

Text (Quote, centered in upper third): "A ship is just a promise."
Text (Attribution, smaller, below quote): "— Alexios"

General Instruction:
Text should be elegant, readable against background. The atmosphere should be peaceful, conclusive. Keep composition simple and powerful. The two ships represent two lives, two cultures, one builder.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## END OF SCRIPT

### Production Notes

- **Total images to generate:** 17 (cover + 15 pages + back cover)
- **Character references needed first:** 3 (Nikos, Alexios, Hasdrubal)
- **Alexios only appears on Pages 1-4.** After that, only upload Nikos and Hasdrubal references.
- **Pages 5-7 are Nikos alone.** Only upload Nikos reference.
- **Hasdrubal first appears on Page 9 (distant) and properly on Page 10.**
- **The carved wooden ship** is a recurring visual motif — it should appear consistently when specified.
- **The shell necklace** is the other visual throughline — ensure it's visible in key moments.
- **[PASTE FULL _____ LOCK BLOCK]** means copy the entire character block from `02-CHARACTERS.md` verbatim into that spot in the prompt before generating.

### Anti-Drift Watch List

The following pages are most likely to drift toward children's book aesthetics. If they do, add this line to the prompt and regenerate:

```
STYLE REINFORCEMENT: This is NOT a children's book illustration. Render in a serious, mature graphic novel style with realistic proportions, natural lighting, and cinematic composition. The protagonist is young but the visual treatment is adult.
```

**High-risk pages:**
- **Nikos reference sheet** — 9-year-old as subject, most likely to trigger soft rendering
- **Page 5 (The Sea)** — vulnerable boy alone, models default to soft/dreamy
- **Page 7 (The Shore)** — child washed ashore, models may go sentimental
- **Page 8 (Sidon)** — small boy in big city, "wide-eyed wonder" trap
- **Page 11 (Apprentice)** — master/apprentice dynamic can trigger "mentor warmth" softness

If you see oversized eyes, rounded features, bright saturated colors, soft focus, or whimsical atmosphere on ANY page — that's drift. Regenerate.
