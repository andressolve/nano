## Palette Notes

Life Two shifts from Life One's warm Mediterranean golds to **darker, more dramatic tones**:

- **Deep ocean blue** — the dominant color. The sea at night, the deep water of Salamis, the Aegean in winter
- **Fire orange** — burning ships, torchlight, the battle, Athenian forge-light
- **Charcoal black** — smoke, ship hulls, night sky, the weight of war
- **Bronze gold** — armor, Athenian architecture, warm lamplight in quiet scenes
- **Storm gray** — overcast skies, the sea before battle, stone walls of Athens

The first 5 pages (Sidon departure) can still carry some of Life One's warm sienna tones — a visual bridge. By page 6 (open sea / fleet), the palette should be fully shifted to the darker scheme. The Salamis battle (pages 8-10) should be the darkest and most saturated. Athens pages (12-15) introduce more bronze gold as stability returns.

## What This Should Look Like

- Eric Shanower's "Age of Bronze" — grounded historical realism
- The naval battle atmosphere of "Master and Commander" — chaos, smoke, wood splinters
- Athens should feel like Ridley Scott's ancient cities — crowded, real, dusty, alive

## What This Should NOT Look Like

- NOT anime or manga
- NOT cartoon violence (the battle should feel heavy and consequential, not action-movie fun)
- NOT bright tourist-postcard Athens
- NOT children's book illustration at any point
