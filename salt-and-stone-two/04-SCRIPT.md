A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels arranged vertically: top wide (30%), middle wide (40%), bottom wide (30%). Hasdrubal's shipyard in Sidon. Late afternoon, warm golden light.

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot of the shipyard. Nikos works confidently on a ship hull with an adze — skilled, practiced strokes. He is no longer an apprentice. Hasdrubal works nearby on a different section. They share the space as equals.
Text (Caption Box): "Five years I built ships in Sidon."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos and Hasdrubal sit together eating lunch on the workbench. Nikos speaks Phoenician now — the conversation is easy. Nikos gestures at a hull design scratched on a wax tablet between them. They're discussing it as colleagues.
Text (Speech Bubble - Nikos): "The keel is too narrow for that beam width."
Text (Speech Bubble - Hasdrubal): "Then fix it. It's your design."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's hands on the wood — strong, calloused, scarred. The scar on his left palm visible. These are a craftsman's hands now. The shell necklace hangs into frame from above.

Text (Caption Box): "The Great King called his fleet."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Hasdrubal and Nikos stand among the gathered crowd, listening. Hasdrubal's expression is grim but unsurprised — he's seen this before. Nikos stares at the Persian ship. The last time he saw a ship like that, his island was burning.
Text (Caption Box): "Every shipyard in Phoenicia. Every able sailor. Every ship that could carry a ram."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Close-up on Nikos's face. His jaw is tight. His dark eyes reflect the Persian warship. Behind him, blurred, Hasdrubal's hand reaches toward his shoulder.
Text (Caption Box): "Xerxes wanted Greece."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "And I was Phoenician enough to be conscripted."

General Instruction:
Tense atmosphere. The warm Sidon palette begins to cool — military intrusion.

Text: [No Text]

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Hasdrubal and Nikos face each other in the workshop doorway. Hasdrubal grips Nikos's shoulders with both hands. Their eyes meet. No sentimentality — this is two men who know what war means.
Text (Speech Bubble - Hasdrubal): "Come back to my yard, boy. I'm too old to train another one."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Large):
Visual: Wide shot. Nikos walks away from the workshop toward the harbor, where warships are moored in the dawn light. Hasdrubal stands in the doorway watching him go. The composition echoes Life One — a father figure watching a boy leave. But this time Nikos walks forward, not backward. He is not being carried away. He is walking.
Text (Caption Box): "My first father stayed behind so I could leave."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "My second father let me go so I could come back."

General Instruction:
Emotional but restrained. The echo of Life One's farewell should be felt in composition, not explained.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 4 — The Ship

**Narrative beat:** Nikos boards the trireme. Meets Captain Mazaeus. He is now crew on a warship — a weapon, not a workshop.

**Upload:** Nikos (youth) + Mazaeus reference images

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels: top wide (35%), middle wide (30%), bottom wide (35%). A Phoenician trireme at dock. Morning, cool blue light.

Visual: Low angle shot looking up at the trireme from the dock. The ship is massive — triple-banked oars, a bronze ram at the waterline, a painted eye on the prow. Nikos stands at the base of the gangplank looking up. He knows ships, but this is not a merchant vessel. This is a weapon.
Text (Caption Box): "I had built ships my whole life. I had never built one meant to kill."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot on deck. Captain Mazaeus stands at the stern, inspecting his crew as they board. He notices Nikos — young, but his hands and bearing say shipwright. Mazaeus's expression is appraising, professional. Not hostile.
Text (Speech Bubble - Mazaeus): "Shipwright's boy?"
Text (Speech Bubble - Nikos): "Shipwright."
Text (Speech Bubble - Mazaeus): "Good. I need someone who knows a hull from the inside."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Nikos takes his position on the rowing bench. He grips the oar. Around him, other sailors settle in — Phoenicians, some Egyptians, a mixed crew of the Persian empire. Nikos looks at his hands on the oar. The scar on his palm. These hands that built ships will now drive one into battle.
Text: [No Text]

General Instruction:
Military atmosphere. The ship should feel imposing and real.
Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 5 — The Fleet

**Narrative beat:** The Persian fleet at sea. Overwhelming scale. Nikos is one person in an empire's war machine.

**Upload:** Nikos (youth) reference image

```
create image: Subject:

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: deep ocean blue, storm gray, charcoal black, bronze gold

CHARACTER NIKOS (must match reference image):
- 14-15 year old youth, shell necklace, dark sailor's tunic

Panel 1 (Top, Splash — half the page):
Visual: High angle wide shot. The Persian fleet stretches across the sea — hundreds of warships in formation, oars churning the gray water in unison. The scale is staggering. Each ship is a dark shape; together they cover the ocean. Overcast sky above.
Text (Caption Box): "They said a thousand ships. I stopped counting at two hundred."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot inside the trireme. Nikos rows with the crew. The drum keeps time. His face is focused, his body in rhythm with the others. He is part of the machine.
Text (Caption Box): "Every oar pulled for Xerxes. Every back bent for Persia."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's face, sweat on his brow, looking sideways out through the oar port. Through the narrow slot, he can see the open sea — and somewhere beyond it, Greece. His expression is unreadable.
Text (Caption Box): "Somewhere ahead was a country I was born in and couldn't remember."

General Instruction:
Scale and isolation. The fleet should feel overwhelming, Nikos tiny within it.
Featuring the same character shown in the reference images.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 6 — The Strait

**Narrative beat:** The fleet enters the Salamis strait. The trap is closing but the Persians don't know it.

```

CHARACTER MAZAEUS (must match reference image):
- ~40 year old captain, shaved head, gold earring, dark blue naval tunic

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot. The fleet enters the narrow strait between Salamis island and the mainland. Mountains rise on both sides — dark, looming. The water narrows. Ships compress together, oars nearly touching between vessels. Mist sits on the water.
Text (Caption Box): "The strait was narrow. Our ships pressed together like cattle in a pen."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Mazaeus stands at the prow, scanning the mist ahead. His expression has changed — the professional calm is tighter now. Something feels wrong. Nikos watches him from the rowing bench.
Text (Speech Bubble - Mazaeus): "Too narrow. We can't turn in this."
Text (Caption Box): "He was the first to understand."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: POV from Nikos's position at the oars, looking forward through the gaps between rowers. Ahead, through the mist, dark shapes emerge — the Greek fleet, waiting. They are positioned. They are ready. This is not a chase. This is an ambush.
Text (Caption Box): "The Greeks were not running."

General Instruction:
Claustrophobic tension. The strait should feel like it's closing around them.
Featuring the same characters shown in the reference images.

**Upload:** Nikos (youth) reference image

```

Color palette: deep ocean blue, fire orange, charcoal black, bronze gold, storm gray

CHARACTER NIKOS (must match reference image):
- 14-15 year old youth, shell necklace, dark sailor's tunic

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot. The two fleets face each other across a shrinking gap of water. Persian/Phoenician ships on the left, Greek triremes on the right. Dawn light breaks through mist between them. The water is still.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's face. He looks across the water at the Greek ships. He can see individual men on the decks — Greek men. Men who look like his father.
Text (Caption Box): "I could see their faces."

Panel 3 (Middle Right, Square):
Visual: Close-up of a Greek sailor on the opposing ship — a young man, roughly Nikos's age, gripping a spear. Scared. Human. A mirror.
Text (Caption Box): "They could see mine."

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot from above. The gap between the fleets closes. Oars surge forward on both sides. The moment before impact.
Text (Caption Box): "Then there was no more water between us."

General Instruction:
The symmetry between the two middle panels is key — two young men on opposite sides, both human.
Featuring the same character shown in the reference images.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 8 — Salamis: The Ram

**Narrative beat:** The battle begins. A Greek trireme rams Nikos's ship. Chaos, violence, the end of everything.

```
create image: Subject:

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: deep ocean blue, fire orange, charcoal black, bronze gold
Effects: Fire, smoke, splintering wood, churning water, maximum intensity

CHARACTER NIKOS (must match reference image):
- 14-15 year old youth, shell necklace, dark sailor's tunic

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot. Ships colliding. Oars shattering like matchsticks. A Greek trireme drives its bronze ram into the hull of a Phoenician ship. Soldiers on both sides brace for impact. Fire arrows arc through the smoke-filled sky.
Text (Caption Box): "Salamis was not a battle. It was a shipwreck with weapons."

Panel 2 (Middle, Splash):
Visual: The moment of the ram hitting Nikos's ship. The bronze ram punches through the hull below the waterline. Timber explodes inward. Water rushes in. Nikos is thrown from his bench. The world tilts. Oars snap. Men scream. This should be visceral and grounded — not stylized action, but real destruction.
Text (Sound Effect, large): "KRAAAKOOM"

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Nikos on the tilting deck, grabbing at anything solid. The ship lists hard. Water pours through the breach. Around him, men scramble, fall, slide toward the gap. The carved wooden ship falls from his belt pouch — he grabs for it.
Text: [No Text]

General Instruction:
This is the most intense page. Visceral, grounded destruction — not cartoon violence.
Featuring the same character shown in the reference images.

CHARACTER NIKOS (must match reference image):
- 14-15 year old youth, shell necklace, dark sailor's tunic (now soaked)

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Nikos surfaces in the churning water. Wreckage everywhere — broken oars, timber, rope. Burning oil on the water's surface in patches. Ships loom above like dark walls. He gasps for air.
Text (Caption Box): "The sea took me again."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Half-underwater shot. Nikos treads water, face at surface level. Below the waterline, dark shapes of sinking wreckage descend into blue-black depth. Above, fire and smoke. The shell necklace floats at his throat. His hand clutches the carved wooden ship — he saved it.
Text (Caption Box): "I was nine the first time. I survived because I was small and the sea was indifferent."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "I was fourteen the second time. I survived because I was strong and the sea was busy."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos swims through the wreckage toward a shape in the mist — a ship. Not a Phoenician ship. The painted hull markings are Greek. It's the only thing close enough to reach.
Text: [No Text]

General Instruction:
Echo the shipwreck from Life One but darker. The shell necklace and wooden ship are visual anchors.
Featuring the same character shown in the reference images.

Color palette: deep ocean blue, charcoal black, bronze gold, weathered wood brown
Effects: Post-battle exhaustion, gray light, wet surfaces, tension

CHARACTER NIKOS (must match reference image):

CHARACTER DEON (must match reference image):
- ~25 year old Athenian sailor, curly brown hair cropped short, scruffy beard, muscular stocky build, anchor tattoo on left forearm

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Nikos is hauled over the rail of the Athenian trireme by two sailors. He collapses on the deck, dripping, gasping. Greek sailors surround him — armed, suspicious. One reaches for a blade. Nikos is wearing Phoenician clothing. He is the enemy.
Text (Caption Box): "They pulled me from the water like a fish."

Panel 2 (Middle Left, Square):
Visual: Close-up of an Athenian marine pointing a spear at Nikos's chest. Aggressive, post-battle adrenaline.
Text (Speech Bubble - Marine): "Phoenician dog."

Visual: Close-up of Nikos's face — water streaming down, eyes steady. He opens his mouth and speaks.
Text (Speech Bubble - Nikos): "I am Greek."

Panel 4 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. The sailors hesitate. Deon steps forward — a big man with an easy face, curious rather than hostile. He looks at Nikos more carefully. Nikos speaks in clear Attic Greek. The accent is rusty but real.
Text (Speech Bubble - Deon): "Greek boys don't row for Phoenicia."
Text (Speech Bubble - Nikos): "This one did."

Tense, then a crack of recognition. Deon's curiosity saves Nikos's life.

CHARACTER DEON (must match reference image):
- ~25 year old Athenian sailor, curly brown hair, scruffy beard, anchor tattoo

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot. The Salamis strait at sunset. The battle is over. Burning Phoenician ships dot the water, sending columns of black smoke into the orange sky. Wreckage covers the surface. The Greek fleet drifts among the ruins of the Persian navy.
Text (Caption Box): "The Greeks won. The Phoenicians drowned."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos sits against the rail of the Athenian ship, wrapped in a rough blanket someone gave him. Deon sits nearby, eating bread. The crew celebrates around them — but Nikos stares at the burning fleet. Those were his ships. His crewmates. Mazaeus. Possibly Hasdrubal's ships.
Text (Caption Box): "The men around me cheered for every burning hull."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "I had helped build some of those hulls."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's hand. He holds the carved wooden ship — still wet. A Greek ship, carved by a Greek father, carried through a Phoenician life, saved from a Persian battle by Greek hands. The shell necklace hangs in frame above.
Text (Caption Box): "My father built Greek ships. I built Phoenician ships. Both were burning."

General Instruction:
Devastation and moral complexity. Nikos is not relieved or triumphant — he is shattered.

Color palette: bronze gold, warm stone, deep blue harbor water, dusty earth, olive green
Effects: Clear morning light, bustling port energy, construction noise

CHARACTER NIKOS (must match reference image):
- 14-15 year old youth, shell necklace, now wearing a plain Greek chiton (he's changed clothes)

CHARACTER DEON (must match reference image):
- ~25 year old Athenian sailor, curly brown hair, scruffy beard, anchor tattoo

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide establishing shot of Piraeus. The port of Athens — stone quays, wooden cranes, ships in dry dock, market stalls, sailors and workers everywhere. It is loud, crowded, alive. In the foreground, Nikos and Deon walk along the quay. Nikos takes it in — another harbor, another life.
Text (Caption Box): "Athens smelled like every port I'd known. Salt, tar, and ambition."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Deon leads Nikos into a shipyard — an Athenian yard, with Greek triremes under construction. Nikos's eyes move across the work with professional recognition. Different ships, different methods, same craft.
Text (Speech Bubble - Deon): "You said you're a shipwright. Prove it."
Text (Speech Bubble - Nikos): "Which hull?"

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Nikos runs his hand along the exposed ribs of an Athenian trireme under construction. His touch is expert. A Greek foreman watches, impressed despite himself. Nikos's expression is focused — this is his language, spoken in a new accent.
Text (Caption Box): "Three ways to build a ship. My father's way. Hasdrubal's way. And now a third."

General Instruction:
Energy and possibility. Athens is not warm like Sidon — it's sharper, louder, more competitive.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 13 — The Democracy

**Narrative beat:** Nikos sees Athenian democracy for the first time. Men arguing openly, deciding policy, debating in the Agora. Themistocles visible. The contrast with Persia's imperial command.

**Upload:** Nikos (youth) reference image

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels: top wide (35%), middle wide (35%), bottom wide (30%). Athens Agora. Midday, bright clear light.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: bronze gold, white marble, warm stone, olive green, clear blue sky

CHARACTER NIKOS (must match reference image):
- 14-15 year old youth, shell necklace, plain Greek chiton

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Wide shot of the Athenian Agora — an open marketplace and civic space. Men gather in clusters, arguing, debating, gesturing. No emperor, no heralds, no commands from above. In the background, the Acropolis rises — damaged from the Persian sacking, scaffolding visible where rebuilding has begun.
Text (Caption Box): "In Persia, one man decided. In Athens, every man decided."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. A crowd gathers around a powerful figure speaking — Themistocles, the hero of Salamis. He is charismatic, commanding, surrounded by supporters and critics alike. Men shout agreement and disagreement openly. Nikos stands at the edge of the crowd, watching. He has never seen power challenged to its face before.
Text (Caption Box): "They cheered him and insulted him in the same breath."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "And he stood there and took both."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's face in the crowd. His expression is complex — wonder, skepticism, fascination. He has lived under Persian imperial order (through Phoenicia) and now sees its opposite. Neither system is simple.
Text (Caption Box): "I had lived in an empire that ran like a machine. Now I lived in a city that argued like a family."

General Instruction:
The Agora should feel real and messy — not a painting of idealized democracy, but the noisy, contentious, extraordinary reality.

Text (Caption Box): "The Greeks called me Phoenician."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos's hands. In one hand, the carved wooden ship — Greek, made by his father. In the other, his Phoenician carving knife. Two lives, two identities, held in two hands. The scar across his left palm catches the moonlight.
Text (Caption Box): "The Phoenicians had called me Greek."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "The sea didn't call me anything. It just kept taking and returning me."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Splash):
Visual: Wide shot from behind Nikos, sitting on the quay, looking out at the moonlit harbor. Ships of a dozen nations moored around him — Greek, Phoenician, Egyptian, Corinthian. He is a small figure in a vast port that connects the world. The Acropolis is a dark shape on the hill behind him, scaffolding catching moonlight.
Text (Caption Box): "I was not Greek. I was not Phoenician. I was not Persian."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "I was the water between them."

General Instruction:
Solitary, contemplative. The most interior page of the chapter. Quiet and vast.
Featuring the same character shown in the reference images.

## PAGE 15 — The Third Life Begins

**Narrative beat:** Final page. Nikos at the Piraeus shipyard at dawn. He is building again — Greek ships this time. The cycle continues. Foreshadows Life Three.

**Upload:** Nikos (youth) reference image

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels: top wide (25%), middle wide (25%), bottom splash (50%). Piraeus shipyard. Dawn.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: bronze gold, deep ocean blue, warm stone, dawn pink, cedar brown
Effects: Dawn light — golden and cool blue mixed. First light on stone and timber. New beginning.

CHARACTER NIKOS (must match reference image):
- 14-15 year old youth, shell necklace, plain work tunic, tools at his belt

Panel 1 (Top, Wide):
Visual: Medium shot. Nikos in the Athenian shipyard at dawn, before anyone else arrives. He picks up an adze — a Greek adze, shaped differently from Hasdrubal's Phoenician tools, shaped differently from his father's island tools. A third way. He tests its weight.
Text (Caption Box): "Every shipyard teaches you the same thing in a different language."

Panel 2 (Middle, Wide):
Visual: Close-up of Nikos beginning to work on a hull plank. His hands move with confidence — Phoenician technique applied to a Greek hull. He is synthesizing everything he's learned. The scar on his palm, the shell necklace swinging as he works.
Text (Caption Box): "My father said: the wood tells you what it wants to be."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "Hasdrubal said the same thing. In Phoenician."

Panel 3 (Bottom, Splash):
Visual: Wide shot of the Piraeus shipyard at sunrise. Nikos works alone at the hull while the first light paints the harbor gold. Behind him, Athens is waking up — workers arriving, fires being lit, the Acropolis catching the first sunlight. The sea stretches to the horizon beyond the harbor mouth. Somewhere out there: the world he's crossed twice.
Text (Caption Box): "I was fifteen years old."
Text (Caption Box, lower): "I had already lived two lives. The sea was not done with me."

General Instruction:
Dawn, hope, but with an edge. Not a happy ending — a pause before the next storm. The final caption foreshadows Life Three.
Featuring the same character shown in the reference images.

## BACK COVER

**Upload:** None needed

```
create image: Subject:
A simple, contemplative back cover image. An oar stuck upright in sand on a beach at sunset. The sea stretches to the horizon. On the sand beside the oar, three small shapes: a carved wooden ship, a Phoenician adze, and a Greek chisel. Three tools from three lives.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Color palette: deep ocean blue, bronze gold, sunset orange, warm sand, charcoal shadow
Effects: Sunset, long shadows, peaceful exhaustion

Text (Quote, centered in upper third): "There are no clean sides. There is only the sea, and what you build after it breaks you."
Text (Attribution, smaller, below quote): "— Salt and Stone"

General Instruction:
Elegant, readable text against the sunset. Peaceful, conclusive. Simple and powerful.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## END OF SCRIPT

### Production Notes

- **Total images to generate:** 17 (cover + 15 pages + back cover) — save to `~/nano/salt-and-stone-life-two/pages/`
- **Character references needed first:** 4 (Nikos Youth, Hasdrubal, Mazaeus, Deon) — save to `~/nano/salt-and-stone-life-two/refs/`
- **Hasdrubal only appears on Pages 1-3.** Upload his ref for those pages only.
- **Mazaeus appears on Pages 4, 6.** Upload his ref for those pages.
- **Deon appears on Pages 10-12.** Upload his ref for those pages.
- **Pages 5, 7-9, 13-15 are Nikos-focused.** Upload only Nikos ref.
- **The carved wooden ship** continues as a visual motif from Life One.
- **The shell necklace** must be visible in key moments (Pages 1, 3, 9, 11, 14).
- **Prompt length:** Each prompt is designed to be under ~800 words. Do NOT pad them.

### Anti-Drift Watch List

High-risk pages for aesthetic drift:
- **Page 5 (The Fleet)** — vast scale can trigger "illustration" mode instead of cinematic
- **Pages 8-9 (Battle/Water)** — violence may get softened or stylized
- **Page 13 (Democracy)** — Agora can go "textbook illustration" instead of gritty reality
- **Page 14 (Night)** — solitary teen at night can trigger "anime" or "dreamy" drift

If drift occurs, add:
```
STYLE REINFORCEMENT: This is NOT a children's book. Render in serious, mature graphic novel style with realistic proportions and cinematic composition.
```
