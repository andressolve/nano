# Salt and Stone — Life Two Setting Definitions

## SIDON SHIPYARD (returning location, 5 years later)

```
SETTING: SIDON SHIPYARD
- Hasdrubal's workshop, now larger and busier. Multiple ship hulls in various stages.
- Nikos's workbench is established — his own tools, his own space. He belongs here.
- Warm golden light, sawdust, the smell of pitch and cedar. The harbor visible through the open side.
- Palette: warm sienna and gold (carry-over from Life One palette — this is the last warm setting)
```

## SIDON HARBOR — FLEET MUSTER

```
SETTING: SIDON HARBOR - FLEET MUSTER
- The commercial harbor transformed into a military staging ground.
- Dozens of warships — Phoenician triremes with painted eyes on the prow — moored in tight rows.
- Persian military standards and banners. Soldiers, sailors, supplies being loaded.
- The scale is overwhelming — this is the largest naval force in history being assembled.
- Palette: transitional — warm harbor tones giving way to darker blues and military bronze
```

## THE FLEET AT SEA

```
SETTING: FLEET AT SEA
- Hundreds of warships in formation on open water. The scale is staggering.
- Nikos's trireme among them — a single ship in an armada stretching to the horizon.
- The sky is overcast, the sea is deep dark blue-gray. Military drumbeats keep rowing pace.
- Palette: deep ocean blue, storm gray, charcoal. The warm tones of Sidon are gone.
```

## SALAMIS STRAIT — BEFORE BATTLE

```
SETTING: SALAMIS STRAIT - PRE-BATTLE
- The narrow strait between the island of Salamis and the Greek mainland.
- The Persian/Phoenician fleet packed into the strait, ships nearly touching.
- Greek triremes visible ahead — a smaller force, but positioned with the current.
- Dawn light, mist on the water, tension. The mountains of the mainland loom on both sides.
- Palette: gray dawn, deep blue water, dark ship hulls, bronze glints of weapons
```

## SALAMIS STRAIT — THE BATTLE

```
SETTING: SALAMIS - BATTLE
- Total naval chaos. Ships ramming, oars shattering, men in the water.
- Fire on some ships — flaming arrows, burning pitch. Thick black smoke.
- The strait is too narrow — Persian ships are colliding with each other trying to maneuver.
- Screaming, wood cracking, the roar of impact. Water churning with wreckage and bodies.
- Palette: fire orange against deep ocean blue and charcoal black. Maximum contrast.
```

## THE WATER (after the ramming)

```
SETTING: IN THE WATER - POST-RAM
- Nikos in the sea, surrounded by floating wreckage — broken oars, planking, bodies.
- The battle continues above and around him but he is at water level — vulnerable, small.
- Sound is muffled. The world above is chaos; the world at water level is strangely quiet.
- This echoes the shipwreck from Life One — he is in the sea AGAIN.
- Palette: deep blue-black water, distant orange firelight reflected on the surface
```

## ATHENIAN TRIREME (rescue)

```
SETTING: ATHENIAN TRIREME
- A Greek warship, different from the Phoenician ships — sleeker, lighter.
- The deck is crowded with Athenian rowers and marines. Post-battle energy — exhaustion and triumph.
- Nikos is pulled aboard dripping, surrounded by men who were just trying to kill him.
- Palette: weathered wood, off-white sails, bronze weapons, sea-spray
```

## PIRAEUS (Port of Athens)

```
SETTING: PIRAEUS
- The port district of Athens. Crowded, loud, commercial, alive.
- Shipyards (Nikos's world), market stalls, sailors from across the Mediterranean.
- Stone quays, wooden cranes, half-built triremes in dry dock. Working class energy.
- Not the tourist Athens of the Acropolis — this is the docks, the real city.
- Palette: bronze gold, warm stone, deep blue harbor water, dusty earth
```

## ATHENS — AGORA / CITY

```
SETTING: ATHENS
- The city in its early golden age. Construction everywhere — temples, walls, public buildings.
- The Agora: open marketplace where democracy happens in the open air. Men arguing, debating, trading.
- Themistocles visible in the distance at one point — a powerful figure, celebrated, surrounded by supporters.
- The Acropolis on the hill above, still damaged from the Persian sacking, beginning to be rebuilt.
- Palette: bronze gold, white marble, warm stone, olive green, clear blue sky
