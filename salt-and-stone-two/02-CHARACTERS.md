# Salt and Stone — Life Two Character Definitions

## CRITICAL: How Character Locking Works

The **reference image** does 80% of the character locking. The text lock block below is just reinforcement — it reminds the model of details the reference image already shows. Keep it short.

For every page prompt:
1. **Upload the reference image(s)** for all characters in the scene
2. Paste the SHORT lock block below
3. Include the phrase: "featuring the same characters shown in the reference images"

That's it. Do NOT pad the lock block with atmospheric or redundant description.

## NIKOS (The Youth) — Age 14-15

### Lean Lock Block (paste into prompts)

```
CHARACTER NIKOS (must match reference image):
- 14-15 year old Greek-Phoenician youth, lean and athletic, tanned olive skin
- Sharp dark brown eyes, angular jaw emerging, same face as the boy but older
- Thick black hair, longer now, tied back with a leather cord for shipwork
- Signature marks: scar across left palm, shell necklace on leather cord (ALWAYS VISIBLE)
- Outfit varies by scene (see script) — default: Phoenician sailor's tunic, dark linen, rope belt
```

### Reference Sheet Prompt

Upload Life One Nikos (boy) reference image from `~/nano/salt-and-stone/refs/` if available, then generate:

```
create image: Subject:
Character reference sheet showing a 14-15 year old Greek youth in two views side by side: close-up portrait on left, full body on right.

This character is the SAME PERSON as the boy in the uploaded reference image, now five years older. Same eyes, same bone structure, same scar on left palm, same shell necklace — but taller, leaner, jaw more angular, hair longer and tied back.

Left panel — Portrait:
Close-up. Sharp dark brown eyes, angular face, hint of his father's strong brow. Expression: steady, watchful, mature beyond his years. Shell necklace visible at collarbone. Hair tied back with leather cord, a few strands loose.

Right panel — Full body:
Standing, 3/4 view. Lean athletic build from years of shipwork. Dark linen Phoenician-style tunic to mid-thigh, rope belt, leather sandals. Calloused hands, scar visible on left palm. About 5'6" — not yet a full man but no longer a boy.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture, historical graphic novel aesthetic
Background: Simple warm neutral gradient
Lighting: Soft even front-left lighting, studio reference style

General Instruction:
Reference sheet for character consistency. Both views must show the exact same person. This is a serious historical graphic novel — render with realistic proportions, no stylization.

Aspect Ratio: 4:3 (landscape)
