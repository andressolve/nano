            <p>The Festival of Minerva was supposed to be his moment. He had practiced the poem for weeks. Every word, every pause, every gesture. His father had said he would make the family proud.</p>
            <p>Instead, his mind had gone blank. He had stood there, mouth open, while the silence stretched. Then someone had laughed. Then everyone.</p>
            <p>His sandals slapped against the stone paths of the palace gardens. The evening light was turning golden, but Gaius didn't notice. All he could hear was the echo of that laughter, playing over and over in his head.</p>
